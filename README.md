# Learn GraphQL Apollo Server 4

Learning **GraphQL** using **Apollo Server** (v4)

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)
- [Apollo Server 4](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v4)

## Getting Started

You should already know the following:

- Javascript/Typescript
- NodeJS
- REST API

We will be using [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com) as editor with its extension: `GraphQL: Syntax Highlighting` (Author: GraphQL Foundation)

The vscode extension is **optional**.

## Next Steps

The **main** branch is blank as we will build everything from scratch.

Move along on the next branches to progress.
